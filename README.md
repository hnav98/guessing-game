# Guessing Game (Python Terminal Edition)

A simple terminal-based guessing game built in Python. The game randomly chooses a secret word, and the player has a limited number of guesses to figure it out. Itâ€™s a great beginner project to learn about loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.

---

## Gameplay

- The player has **3 attempts** to guess the word correctly.
- After each incorrect guess, the number of remaining guesses decreases.
- If the player guesses correctly within the limit: **"You Win!"**
- Otherwise: **"Out of guesses"**
